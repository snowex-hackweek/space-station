## Project Summary

### Space Station

What does spatial variability look like around a snow telemetry station?

### The problem

Identifying spatial variabilty of height of snow and snow water equivalence of the surrounding snowpack in relation to the Wx stations.

### Application Example

Identifying which remote weather stations have more representative snow measurements with respect to their surrounding areas.

### Sample data

- SNOTEL Network
- SnowEx Point data
- SnowEx Lidar data
- MesoWest Wx station network

### Existing methods

How would you or others traditionally try to address this problem?

### Proposed methods/tools

Building from what you learn at this hackweek, what new approaches would you like to try to implement?

### Background reading

Optional: links to manuscripts or technical documents for more in-depth analysis.
